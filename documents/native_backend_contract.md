# Alpha 1 Native Backend Contract

Canonical language rules: see [core_language_rules.md](core_language_rules.md).

This document records the first native backend contract for Alpha 1. The executable source of truth is `crates/lullaby_ir/src/native_contract.rs`.

## Status

Implemented now:

- A serializable `NativeBackendContract` data model in `lullaby_ir`.
- A deterministic `alpha1_native_backend_contract()` baseline.
- `alpha1_value_layout(TypeRef)` coverage for the current Alpha 1 type surface: `void`, `i64`, `bool`, `string`, `array<T>`, and `ptr_*`.
- Unit tests for target selection, current value layouts, cleanup sequencing, and JSON round-trip stability.
- A checked-in JSON snapshot under `crates/lullaby_ir/tests/snapshots/alpha1_native_backend_contract.json`.

Not implemented yet:

- Machine-code lowering.
- Object file writing.
- Object-emission snapshots.
- Linker orchestration.
- Native runtime packaging.

## Targets

The first native prototype target is `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` with COFF object emission. The contract also records the intended 64-bit target family for later work:

- `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
- `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
- `x86_64-apple-darwin`
- `aarch64-apple-darwin`

All current contract targets are 64-bit little-endian targets.

## Calling Convention

The Alpha 1 backend uses an internal Lullaby ABI before adapting to platform object and linker conventions:

- Parameters lower in source order.
- `main` remains the zero-argument entry function for executable validation.
- Scalar and handle return values are returned directly.
- Variadic calls are not part of Alpha 1.
- Call boundaries require 16-byte alignment.

## Stack Frame

Native lowering must model stable slots for:

- parameters
- locals
- temporaries
- spills
- cleanup records

Cleanup order is driven by `IrMemoryOperation.sequence`, matching the bytecode artifact memory metadata.

## Value Layout

The current Alpha 1 value layouts are:

| Type pattern | Class | Size | Alignment | Pass/return mode |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `void` | no payload | 0 bytes | 1 byte | no payload |
| `i64` | integer | 8 bytes | 8 bytes | direct value |
| `bool` | boolean | 1 byte | 1 byte | direct value |
| `string` | runtime handle | 8 bytes | 8 bytes | pointer-sized handle |
| `array<T>` | runtime descriptor handle | 8 bytes | 8 bytes | pointer-sized handle |
| `ptr_*` | heap pointer handle | 8 bytes | 8 bytes | pointer-sized handle |

The contract intentionally treats strings, arrays, and heap pointers as pointer-sized handles. Inline string bytes, array element storage, and heap-slot contents remain runtime-managed.

## Pointer And Array Rules

Safe source operations must not lower null pointer values. Native lowering for `load`, `store`, and `dealloc` must preserve the same live-resource requirements recorded in memory-operation metadata.

Arrays lower as runtime descriptor handles. The descriptor contains a logical `length: i64` and a pointer-sized handle to contiguous element storage. Indexing must preserve bounds-check semantics before element access.

## Cleanup And Diagnostics

Explicit release and future compiler cleanup must share `IrMemoryOperation.sequence` so bytecode and native backends make the same resource-order decisions.

Native backend diagnostics must use the shared `N####` diagnostic model. Target-specific failures must include the target triple.

## Next Backend Work

The next native backend checkpoint should use this contract to add object-emission snapshots or a prototype object-emission crate/module for `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`. It should not bypass the AST runtime, typed IR validation, bytecode VM, or existing release verification.
